## SUMMARY
Custom reference database, ngsfilter file, and R scripts associated with the article titled "Trapped DNA frangments in marine sponge specimens unveil north Atlantic deep-sea fish diversity" published in Proceedings of the Royal Society B.

## DATA & FILE OVERVIEW

1. File List:

A) ngsfilter_natl_teleo.txt

B) Trapped_DNA_marine_sponge_database_03042022.ACC.taxonomy.txt

C) 12S_trim_teleo_04032022.fasta

D) all_ids.csv

E) from_original_data_to_data_for_analysis_commented_s1.R

F) preparing_metadata_for_plots_commented_s2.R

G) map_figure1_s3.R

H) nmds_figure2_s4.R

I) bubbleplot_figure3_s5.R

J) violinplots_figure4_s6.R


2. Relationship between files: Files A to C along with the raw sequencing data can be used with the bioinformatic pipeline (detailed in the methods section of the paper) to generate the MOTU tables. Files D-J can be used to replicate the statistical analyses and figures. All R scripts are labeled, indicating the order they should be run in. (e.g. The first script (s1) is 'from_original_data_to_data_for_analysis_s1.R' and the second script (s2) is 'preparing_metadata_for_plots_commented_s2.R')
